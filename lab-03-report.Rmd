Fill in R code for the exercises 
(I have put the comment `# TODO` in all of the code chunks where you need to 
do this)
and then fill in the answers where I have marked **Answer:**. 
Be sure to write explanations of your answer and don't just put numbers with 
no text.

## Exercise 4.1: Methane

Methane has a current concentration of 1.7 ppm in the atmosphere and
is doubling at a faster rate than CO~2~.

a) **Would an additional 10 ppm of methane in the atmosphere have a larger or 
   smaller impact on the outgoing IR flux than an additional 10 ppm of CO~2~ 
   at current concentrations?**

   **Hint:**
   See the suggestion in the `lab-03-instructions` document.

```{r ex_4_1_a, include=TRUE, message=FALSE}

#current concentrations
currentConditions = run_modtran(filename = "currentconditions_modtran")

plot_modtran(modtran_data = currentConditions, descr = "Current Conditons")

#I_out with current conditions = 298.67

mod_q1ch4 = run_modtran(file.path(data_dir, "modtran_Q1_ch4.txt"), ch4_ppm = 11.7)
# additional 10 ppm of Methane

mod_q1co2 = run_modtran(file.path(data_dir, "modtran_Q1_co2.txt"), co2_ppm = 410)
#additional 10 ppm of CO2

plot_modtran(modtran_data = mod_q1ch4, descr = "Methane = 11.7 ppm")

plot_modtran(modtran_data = mod_q1co2, descr = "CO2 = 410 ppm")
```

**Answer:** Adding 10 ppm of methane to the atmosphere would have a larger impact on the outgoing infrared radiation than an increase of 10 ppm of CO~2~. 
When plotted, the 10 ppm increase in methane would decrease output of Infrared radiation by a value of 3.11, while 10 ppm CO~2~ increase only decreases it by 0.12.

b) **Where in the spectrum does methane absorb? What concentration does it take 
   to begin to saturate the absorption in this band? Explain what you are looking 
   at to judge when the gas is saturated.**

   **Hints:**  
   See the hints in the `lab-03-instructions` document.

```{r ex_4_1_b, include=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# TODO
# Put your R code here
```

**Answer:** _Put your answer here._ Be sure to show your work and
include any data, plots, etc. that you need in order to explain how
you came up with your answer.

  
c) **Would a doubling of methane have as great an impact on the heat balance as a 
   doubling of CO~2~?**

   **Hint:**
   See the suggestion in the `lab-03-instructions` document.

```{r ex_4_1_c, include=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# TODO
# Put your R code here
```

**Answer:** _Put your answer here._ Be sure to show your work and
include any data, plots, etc. that you need in order to explain how
you came up with your answer.


d) **What is the "equivalent CO~2~" of doubling atmospheric methane? That is to 
   say, how many ppm of CO~2~ would lead to the same change in outgoing IR 
   radiation energy flux as doubling methane? What is the ratio of ppm CO~2~ 
   change to ppm methane change?**

```{r ex_4_1_d, include=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# TODO
# Put your R code here
```

**Answer:** _Put your answer here._ Be sure to show your work and
include any data, plots, etc. that you need in order to explain how
you came up with your answer.


## Exercise 4.2: CO~2~ (Graduate students only)

a) **Is the direct effect of increasing CO~2~ on the energy output at the top of
   the atmosphere larger in high latitudes or in the tropics?**

   **Hint:**
   See the hint in the `lab-03-instructions` document.


```{r ex_4_2_a, include=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# TODO
# Put your R code here
```

**Answer:** _Put your answer here._ Be sure to show your work and
include any data, plots, etc. that you need in order to explain how
you came up with your answer.


b) **Set pCO~2~ to an absurdly high value of 10,000 ppm. You will see a spike
   in the CO~2~ absorption band. What temperature is this light coming from? 
   Where in the atmosphere do you think this comes from?**

   **Now turn on clouds and run the model again. Explain what you see.
   Why are night-time temperatures warmer when there are clouds?**

   **Hint:**
   See the hint in the `lab-03-instructions` document and
   for the second part of this exercise, try using "altostratus" clouds.

```{r ex_4_2_b, include=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# TODO
# Put your R code here
```

**Answer:** _Put your answer here._ Be sure to show your work and
include any data, plots, etc. that you need in order to explain how
you came up with your answer.


## Exercise 4.3: Water vapor

Our theory of climate presumes that an increase in the temperature at ground
level will lead to an increase in the outgoing IR energy flux at the top of the
atmosphere.


a) **How much extra outgoing IR would you get by raising the temperature of the 
   ground by 5&deg;C? What effect does the ground temperature have on the 
   shape of the outgoing IR spectrum and why?**
   
   **Hint:**
   See the hint in the `lab-03-instructions` document.

```{r ex_4_3_a, include=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# TODO
# Put your R code here
```

**Answer:** _Put your answer here._ Be sure to show your work and
include any data, plots, etc. that you need in order to explain how
you came up with your answer.

b) **More water can evaporate into warm air than into cool air. Change the
   model settings to hold the water vapor at constant relative humidity 
   rather than constant vapor pressure (the default), calculate the change
   in outgoing IR energy flux for a 5&deg;C temperature increase.
   Is it higher or lower? Does water vapor make the Earth more sensitive to
   CO~2~ increases or less sensitive?**
   
   **Note:** By default, the MODTRAM model holds water vapor pressure constant,
   but you can set it to hold relative humidity constant instead with the
   option `h2o_fixed = "relative humidity"`, like this:
   `run_modtran(file_name, delta_t = 5, h2o_fixed = "relative humidity")`.

```{r ex_4_3_b, include=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# TODO
# Put your R code here
```

**Answer:** _Put your answer here._ Be sure to show your work and
include any data, plots, etc. that you need in order to explain how
you came up with your answer.

c) **Now see this effect in another way.**

   * **Starting from the default base case, record the total outgoing 
     IR flux.**

   * **Now double CO~2~. The temperature in the model stays the
     same (that's how the model is written), but the outgoing IR flux
     goes down.**

   * **Using constant water vapor pressure, adjust the temperature offset
     until you get the original IR flux back again. Record the change in
     temperature.**
    
   * **Now repeat the exercise, but holding the relative humidity fixed
     instead of the water vapor pressure.**
    
   * **The ratio of the warming when you hold relative humidity fixed
     to the warming when you hold water vapor pressure fixed is the 
     feedback factor for water vapor. What is it?**

```{r ex_4_3_c, include=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# TODO
# Put your R code here
```

**Answer:** _Put your answer here._ Be sure to show your work and
include any data, plots, etc. that you need in order to explain how
you came up with your answer.
